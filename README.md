This repository is a small React app (Vite + TypeScript) that helps you plan study time by letting a student log in, create exams, and auto-generate revision sessions that appear in a calendar. 
It expects a Strapi backend where a Users plugin account is linked one-to-one to an Eleve entry, each Exam links many-to-many to Eleve, and optional Session entries store the generated study slots. Registration creates a user, ensures an Eleve exists, and links them; every screen then filters data by the logged-in user’s Eleve, and when you add an exam it is automatically associated to that Eleve. 
The Dashboard shows your upcoming exams, a FullCalendar view, and buttons to generate or delete a study plan from exam date and weight. 
To run it, set VITE_API_URL in a .env file to your Strapi URL, install dependencies with npm install, and start with npm run dev; for production build with npm run build and deploy the dist folder with the correct API URL. 
In Strapi you must create the described relations, and grant the Authenticated role permissions to find, create, and update eleves, exams, and sessions. 
If you see “Forbidden 403” it is almost always missing permissions, if you see no exams check that the user is linked to an Eleve and that exams are connected to that Eleve, and if you see “Invalid key eleves” your relation field has a different name and you should update the constants in the code.
